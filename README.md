Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approaches to Weight Function Generation in Graph Pebbling

This code base provides an inquiry into Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approaches for 
Weight Function generation in Graph Pebbling. The work is a culimation of one semester of work 
in pursuit of an Applied Mathematics Honors Thesis at Davidson College under the supervision of 
Dr. Carl Yerger and Dr. Jonad Pulaj, and supplements a formal writen final report for the Fall 2021
semester. 

The repository is structured as follows: 
   py -> python scripts
       Optimizer.py -> mixed-integer linear program implementation 
       PebblingGraph.py -> pebbling graph class with appropriate methods for functionality
       TreeStrategy.py -> weight function classes 
       main.py -> compiler file used to run experiments and test function classes 
  visualizations -> saved netowrkx png vizualization files that display tree strategies 
       generated from optimiation problems. *Lemke square visualizations are work in progress* 
  lps -> lp files for optimization problems run using Gurobi solver
  logs -> linear programming logs that track progress of optimization over time 
  lemke_trees -> csv files that store edge sets for lemke square strategies generated by linear programs 
  lemke_certificates -> weight function certificates for Lemke square generated by linear programs 
  bruhat_exp (out dated) -> stores results of optimization experiment on max length and set size for 4th weak Bruhat
